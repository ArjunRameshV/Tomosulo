Tomosulo 

An attempt to try and make a visualization for tomosulo algorithm, to try implicate the importance of out of order execution.

This model is made in vanilla javascript and is a 16-bit unit. 

Currently it is assumed that cache miss does not happen, as it is just another waiting period the simulation. 

It is still in the initial build stage and does not really have all the exceptions handled. (Will soon be updated)
